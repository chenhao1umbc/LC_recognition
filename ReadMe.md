This project is focusing on the Lung Cancer classification problem.

The data is from paper
Lung Nodule Classification Using Biomarkers, Volumetric Radiomics, and 3D CNNs

The main contribution:
1. proposed an data augmenation way for 3D medical imaging
2. Proposed the pre-training algorithm based on unsupervised source separation
3. Come up with a neural network architecture targeting on classification problem.
